# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is an AJAX-based, single-page Twitter clone that utilizes jQuery, HTML5, and CSS. Users can write tweets and see them uploaded real-time onto the page. Additionally, all tweets auto-generate a name, username, and the length of time since they were posted.



## Getting Started

1. [Create](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) a new repository using this repository as a template.
2. Clone your repository onto your local device.
3. Install dependencies using the `npm install` command.
3. Start the web server using the `npm run local` command. The app will be served at <http://localhost:8080/>.
